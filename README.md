This wikiHow teaches you how to use Microsoft Paint on a Windows computer. Microsoft Paint is a classic Windows program that has survived the transition to Windows 10.


## Opening Paint


1. Open Start. Click the Windows logo in the bottom-left corner of the screen.
2. Type in paint. This will search your computer for the Paint program.
3. Look for the Paint app icon. In the Start menu, look for the Paint app icon, which resembles a paint palette with paint on it.
4. Click Paint. It's next to the Paint app icon. Doing so will open a new Paint window.


## Drawing and Erasing


1. Review the toolbar. The toolbar, which is at the top of the Paint window, is where you'll find all of the options used to interact with the Paint canvas.
2. Select a primary color. Click any color in the palette that's in the top-right side of the Paint window to apply it to the "Color 1" box. This is the color that you'll use when using the left mouse button on the canvas.
	* You can create a custom color by clicking Edit colors in the upper-right corner of the window, selecting a color and shade you want to use in the color wheel, and clicking OK.

3. Select a secondary color. Click the "Color 2" box to the left of the color palette, then click the color you'd like to use as your secondary color. You'll activate this color by using the right mouse button on the canvas.
4. Select a brush type. Click the Brushes option at the top of the Paint window, then click the type of brush tip you want to use. This is what affects the line size, shape, and width options.
	* If you just want to draw a regular free-form line, click the pencil-shaped "Pencil" icon in the "Tools" section.
5. Select a line thickness. Click the Size option to the left of the color palette, then click the line thickness you want to use while drawing.
6. Click and drag across the canvas to draw. Holding down the left mouse button while dragging will draw your line.
	* You can click and drag with the right mouse button to use your secondary color.
7. Fill a section with color. Click the "Fill with color" tool, which resembles a paint bucket, in the "Tools" section, then click the canvas to change an entire section of it to your primary color (you can right-click to use your secondary color instead).
	* If you have the canvas sectioned off (e.g., a line dividing the canvas in two), only the section in which you click will be filled with color.
	* If your canvas is blank or contains no full sections, your whole canvas will be filled in when you use the "Fill with color" tool.

8. Erase mistakes. You can use the eraser function by clicking the pink "Eraser" icon in the "Tools" section and then clicking and dragging the eraser over the portion of the image you want to erase.
	* The eraser will use your secondary color, so you may have to reset the secondary color to white (or your drawing's background color, if different) before erasing.
